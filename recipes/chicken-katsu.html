    <p><h3>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</h3></p>
    <p>Make restaurant-worthy chicken katsu at home with this top-rated recipe. You won't believe how quickly it comes together with simple ingredients! Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>
    <p>Allow the chicken katsu to cool completely, then store your leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides. </li>
