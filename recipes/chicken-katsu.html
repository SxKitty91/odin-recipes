        <p><h3>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</h3></p>
        <p>Make restaurant-worthy chicken katsu at home with this top-rated recipe. You won't believe how quickly it comes together with simple ingredients!

        <p>Allow the chicken katsu to cool completely, then store your leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.</p>
