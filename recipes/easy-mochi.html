    <p><h3>Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko).</h3></p>
    <p>They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier. Satisfy your sweet tooth with homemade mochi. Trust us: The process is way simpler than you think. This easy mochi recipe comes together quickly with just a few ingredients. </p>
    <p> What Is Mochi? Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour, or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat elastic. Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which gives it a light green hue. "Mochi" is pronounced "MOE-chee." Fresh mochi should be stored in the freezer. Avoid storing it in the fridge, as it will quickly dry out and harden. Store mochi in an airtight container in the freezer for up to two weeks. To prevent sticking, either flash freeze the mochi before transferring it to the storage container or individually wrap each mochi ball.</p>
    <p><h2>What Is Mochi Made Of?</h2></p>
    <p><strong>Red Bean Paste</strong> - You can buy sweetened red bean paste (also called adzuki bean paste or anko) at the store or you can make it at home with our easy recipe. </p>
    <p><strong>Green Tea Powder</strong> - Green tea powder (or matcha) has a complex, earthy flavor that works well with mochi. Plus, it gives the dessert its gorgeous green color. </p>
    <p><strong>Water</strong> - Water thins the dough, creating the perfect consistency (and making it easier to work with). </p>
    <p><strong>Sugar</strong> - Plain granulated white sugar will add just the right amount of sweetness. </p>
    <p><strong>Cornstarch</strong> - Cornstarch prevents sticking when you're rolling out the dough. </p>
    <p><strong>Glutinous Rice Flour</strong> - Make sure to get glutinous rice flour (mochigome) instead of regular rice flour. This ingredient is essential for mochi's signature chewy texture. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl. </li>
        <li>Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth. </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until completely covered. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking. </li>
        <li>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi. </li>
