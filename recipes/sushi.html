    <p><h3>Sushi rolls can be filled with any ingredients you choose. Try smoked salmon instead of imitation crab meat. Serve with teriyaki sauce and wasabi.</h3></p>
    <p>the hardest part of any sushi recipe is finding a bamboo mat... for a long time mine would come out bulky and uneven and generally not pretty. It's hard to roll sushi with just your hands - the nori rips if you press too hard and the roll comes apart if not hard enough. The easiest thing to do if you cant find a bamboo mat is use a clean dish towel.</p>
    <p>To get the meat and other stuff right in the center of the roll, position it 3/4 down on the rice, rather than the center. Just some sushi tricks I've learned these past few years ^^</p>
