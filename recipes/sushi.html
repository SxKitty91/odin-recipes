        <p><h3>Sushi rolls can be filled with any ingredients you choose. Try smoked salmon instead of imitation crab meat. Serve with teriyaki sauce and wasabi.</h3></p>
        <p>the hardest part of any sushi recipe is finding a bamboo mat... for a long time mine would come out bulky and uneven and generally not pretty. It's hard to roll sushi with just your hands - the nori rips if you press too hard and the roll comes apart if not hard enough. The easiest thing to do if you cant find a bamboo mat is use a clean dish towel.</p>
        <p>To get the meat and other stuff right in the center of the roll, position it 3/4 down on the rice, rather than the center. Just some sushi tricks I've learned these past few years ^^</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
        <li>⅔ cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>½ pound imitation crab meat, flaked</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p>
        <p>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
        <p>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside. </p>
        <p>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet. </p>
        <p>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes. </p>
        <p>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crab meat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. </p>
        <p>Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients. </p>
        <p>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices. </p>
